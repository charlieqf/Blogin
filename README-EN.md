## Start

### Dependencies

1. **Install mysql**

   Go to the official website of MySQL or mariaDB to download the installation package of the corresponding system and install it. Linux users can install via commands.

   ```shell
   sudo apt-get install mysql
   ```

2. **Install redis**

   Go to redis official website to download the installation package for installation. Linux users can install it by following the command.

   ```shell
   sudo apt-get install redis
   ```

   After successful installation, start the RedIS service with the following command.

   ```shell
   sudo service redis-server start
   ```

3. **Create Database**

   Open the terminal, enter the following command to enter the MySQL console, the specific command depends on your own MySQL database settings.

   ```shell
   sudo mysql -u root -p
   ```

   ```mysql
   create database blog CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_general_ci;
   SHOW DATABASES ;
   ```

   If the content of the console output contains the `blog` database, the database was created successfully.

### Initial

1. **Clone code**

   For this step, the git environment must be configured on the local machine first. Please surf the Internet for details.

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/charlieqf/Blogin.git
   ```

2. **Configure environment variables** 

   Many properties in the project are private and confidential, so we can save the values of these properties in the `.env` file, and block the file when uploading the code. Create a new `.env` file in the root directory of the project, and enter the following in the file.

   ```INI
   MAIL_SERVER='your mail server'
   MAIL_USERNAME='your mail username'
   MAIL_PASSWORD='your mail server verify code' # not your email login password
   SECRET_KEY='your project secret'
   DATABASE_USER='your mysql/mariaDB database connect username'
   DATABASE_PWD='your mysql/mariaDB database connect user password'
   # BAIDU trans apiid and key
   BAIDU_TRANS_APPID='your app id for baidu trans'
   BAIDU_TRANS_KEY='your app key for baidu trans'
   # github oauth id and key
   GITHUB_CLIENT_ID='your github client id'
   GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET='your github client secret'
   # gitee oauth id and key
   GITEE_CLIENT_ID='your gitee client id'
   GITEE_CLIENT_SECRET='your gitee client secret'
   ```

   **The mail server can apply for gmail mailbox or other mailbox. Please surf the Internet for the specific application process. It is very simple and will not be described here. **

   Create a new .flaskenv file in the project root directory and enter the following content

   ```ini
   FLASK_APP=blogin
   FLASK_ENV=development
   ```

3. **Create and activate the virtual environment**

   Because the dependencies of each project are different, Python provides a virtual environment tool to isolate the dependencies of each project. Use the following commands to create a virtual environment.

   ```shell
    cd Blogin
     python3 -m venv venv
   ```

   Activate it.

   ```shell
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

   Activate it on Windows OS.

   ```shell
     venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. **Install python dependencies**

   After we enter the virtual environment, we can use the following command to install third-party dependencies.

   ```shell
     cd Blogin
     pip install -r requirements.txt -i https://pypi.douban.com/simple
   ```

5. **Init database**

   Enter the root directory of the project, use the following command to initialize the database.

   ```shell
   cd Blogin
   # init database and some configures
   flask initdb
   # create a admin account
   flask admin
   ```

6. **Run**

   ```shell
   flask run
   ```
